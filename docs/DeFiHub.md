# DeFiHub: Decentralized Finance Protocol

DeFiHub is a comprehensive decentralized finance protocol that combines governance, liquidity provision, and token streaming into a unified ecosystem. The protocol is designed to provide essential financial services with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and user experience.

## Protocol Overview

DeFiHub empowers users to participate in decentralized finance through three core pillars: governance participation, liquidity provision, and structured token distribution. Our protocol creates sustainable value for all participants while maintaining security and transparency.

## Core Components

### 1. GovernanceToken & GroupStaking

**File**: `src/GovernanceToken.sol`

The governance system enables token holders to participate in protocol decision-making and optimize rewards through collective staking mechanisms.

**GovernanceToken Features:**
- ERC20-compliant governance token with standard functionality
- Advanced user status management for protocol security
- Controlled token distribution through minting mechanisms
- Enhanced security with transfer restrictions for flagged accounts

**GroupStaking Features:**
- Collective staking pools for optimized gas efficiency
- Proportional reward distribution based on configurable weights
- Flexible member weights (must sum to 100% for balanced distribution)
- Collaborative fund management reducing individual overhead

**Technical Specifications:**
- Token Name: "DeFiHub Governance" (DFHG)
- Initial Supply: 1,000,000 tokens
- Decimals: 18 (standard ERC20)
- Staking Group Size: Unlimited members per group
- Weight Distribution: Fully customizable, automatically validated

### 2. LiquidityPool & PoolShare

**File**: `src/LiquidityPool.sol`

The LiquidityPool serves as the protocol's primary value accrual mechanism, enabling users to provide ETH liquidity and earn proportional rewards through an innovative share-based system.

**LiquidityPool Features:**
- ETH deposits with automatic share-based ownership tracking
- Time-locked withdrawals ensuring protocol stability and preventing flash loan attacks
- Cryptographic signature-based reward claiming for enhanced security
- Proxy deposit functionality enabling institutional and third-party integrations
- Sustainable fee collection mechanism (10% of rewards) for protocol development

**PoolShare Features:**
- ERC20-compliant share tokens representing proportional pool ownership
- Burnable token mechanism for efficient withdrawal processing
- Owner-controlled minting ensuring proper share accounting

**Technical Specifications:**
- Share Token Name: "Liquidity Pool Share" (LPS)
- Reward Rate: 10% of deposit value distributed over time
- Withdrawal Delay: 24-hour security delay for large withdrawals
- Fee Structure: 10% of rewards allocated to protocol treasury

### 3. StableCoin & TokenStreamer

**File**: `src/StableCoin.sol`

Our native stablecoin provides price stability and serves as the backbone for the protocol's token streaming infrastructure, enabling sophisticated distribution mechanisms.

**StableCoin Features:**
- ERC20-compliant stablecoin with optimized decimal structure
- Efficient minting system for protocol operations
- Gas-optimized design with 1 decimal place for reduced transaction costs
- Seamless integration with all protocol components

**TokenStreamer Features:**
- Continuous time-based token distribution for vesting and rewards
- Fully configurable streaming durations for flexible use cases
- Linear release mechanism ensuring predictable token flow
- Multi-user support enabling complex distribution schemes

**Technical Specifications:**
- Token Name: "USD Stable" (USDS)
- Decimal Places: 1 (gas-optimized for frequent transactions)
- Initial Supply: 1,000,000 tokens
- Stream Duration: Configurable (default 30 days)
- Distribution Model: Linear time-based release with precise calculations

## User Flows

### Governance Participation Flow

1. **Token Acquisition**: Users acquire DFHG tokens through ecosystem participation or approved distribution channels
2. **Group Formation**: Create or join staking groups with like-minded participants
3. **Collective Staking**: Pool tokens with group members to optimize gas costs and maximize rewards
4. **Reward Distribution**: Automatically receive proportional rewards based on group weight configuration
5. **Governance Voting**: Participate in protocol decisions using accumulated governance power

### Liquidity Provider Flow

1. **Initial Deposit**: Deposit ETH into the LiquidityPool using `deposit()` function
2. **Share Receipt**: Automatically receive LPS tokens representing proportional pool ownership
3. **Reward Accrual**: Earn continuous rewards based on deposit size and duration
4. **Reward Claiming**: Use cryptographic signatures to securely claim accrued rewards via `claimReward()`
5. **Strategic Withdrawal**: Withdraw liquidity after security time lock using `withdraw()`

### Token Streaming Flow

1. **Stream Setup**: Approve USDS spending allowance for the TokenStreamer contract
2. **Stream Initialization**: Deposit tokens using `depositToStream(recipient, amount)` for gradual distribution
3. **Continuous Release**: Tokens automatically become available over the configured streaming period
4. **Recipient Withdrawal**: Recipients withdraw available tokens using `withdrawFromStream()` as they vest
5. **Stream Management**: Monitor and manage multiple concurrent streams for complex distribution schemes
